yes, because an interface is a piece of code like a class.

6. **Using the** ***new*** **keyword, can you declare a reference to an interface?**

interface.method()

9. **What are the restrictions on interfaces?**

10. **What is the diﬀerence between an** ***abstract class*** **and an interface?**

An abstract class can contain implementation.

Similar to a virtual method but does not contain a method body. Must be overridden by derived class.

12. **What is an** ***sealed class?***
